## Goal and Audience

I have been at baggage claim like six times in the past twenty days. I think this is just a rant.

This piece might be relevant if:

1. you fly with checked bags.

## High and mighty commandments
- Stand three feet / one meter back from the edge of the carousel. This allows everyone to see their luggage coming in advance & gives people room to grab their bags.
- If bags are stacking on top of each other, move them so that they sit side-by-side. Bad things happen when bags back up at the entry point and start to push against each other. (The carousel moves at least as fast as the input feed, but if bags can't get out of the input feed then you start to see shear forces and those nice Tumi bags become threemis and fourmis...)
- Help people get their suitcases off if it looks like they’re struggling, especially elderly folks.
- Remove the plastic bins that hold duffels/other soft bags after they’re empty. Stack them nearby and make room for more bags.

Thankyouverymuch.
