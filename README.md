# Benjamin Lee's Personal Website

Presently served at www.benleejamin.com.

Q: Tech?

A: Styling via boring plain CSS, built w Jekyll, hosting via Github Pages.

Q: Why not \[library\]?

A: The current setup is simple and easy to update.

Q: Why not \[Notion/Wordpress/Webflow/etc\]?

A: I couldn't find anything that would fit my aesthetic needs, and it's hard to beat Github Pages + Namecheap when it comes to pricing.

Q: \[something else\]

A: \[Please get in touch via the form on the site.\]
